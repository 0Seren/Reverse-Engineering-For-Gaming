    <h1>Part 1: Introduction to Memory</h1>


    <h3>What is memory?</h3>

    <p>For our purposes we will mainly think of memory as being split into two different types: Non-Volitle Memory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory">NVM</a>) and Random Access Memory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>).</p>

    <p>NVM is what we'll think of as any data that is stored on the hard drive of a computer or on a game disc. This data all makes use of the persistant storage of NVM and includes things such as the program's source code, save files, and character models/textures. Typically much of what is stored in NVM is eventually loaded into RAM to be used and manipulated as needed.</p>

    <p>RAM is where a computer stores all data about a program that is currently running. This includes all traditional data, such as a player's location and health value, as well as "non-tradtional" data, which is typically the application's code/instruction set. For now we will be focusing mainly on traditional data in RAM.</p>


    <h3>Ones and Zeros</h3>

    <p>All data in a computer is stored with 0's and 1's combined in different ways. We call these 0's and 1's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>. And we call a collection of 8 bits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">byte</a>. Even though there are some data types that could, theoretically, be stored as a single bit, the smallest unit that is typically used to store a peice of data is a byte, so this is what we'll be focusing on. Another common piece of terminology is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)">word</a>. For our purposes, we'll define a word as 32 bits or, more commonly, 4 bytes.</p>

    <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>

    <p>Shown below is a table containing some <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_types.htm">Primitive Data Types</a>. They are called primitive because they are the lowest form of data and every non-primitive data type is just a combination of one or more of these primitive types.</p>

    <h3>Addresses</h3>

    <p>So now that we know what types of data are available, let's take a look at how these primitive types might be stored in memory. First off, let's take a look at how these data types are used in a programming language (C++).
    <pre><code>    int health =  100;
    bool is_dead = false;
    float x_position = 13.37;</code></pre>

    Here we've declared and initialized three variables all of different types, which we give human readable names of <code2>health</code2>, <code2>is_dead</code2>, and <code2>x_position</code2>. While this is fantastic for us as we can refer to these names anytime we want and work with them that way, this doesn't work so well for the program/application using these variables. Instead the application must refer to each of our variables with a more computer friendly "name", called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address">address</a>. These addresses are useful to the program because they are assigned so that they always correspond to a location in memory (RAM). For instance, the address for <code2>health</code2> may be <hex>1A0C84</hex> (the prefix <hex></hex> represents that we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>), and when the program goes to that location in memory it will find the value of <code2>health</code2>. In a sense, a name of a variable is just an alias for its address. The following table shows how this looks:</p>
    <p><table>
      <tr>
        <th>Value</th>
        <td><value>100</value></td>
        <td><value>false</value></td>
        <td><value>13.37</value></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Address</th>
        <td><hex>1A0C84</hex></td>
        <td><hex>1A0C88</hex></td>
        <td><hex>1A0C89</hex></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <td><code2>health</code2></td>
        <td><code2>is_dead</code2></td>
        <td><code2>x_position</code2></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Quick Note: Notice how the addresses are spaced apart according to how many bytes each data type takes up (Integer takes 4, Boolean 1).</p>
